# Overview

*LogINvisible* is an academic project developed during my secod semester of Software Engineering.
It represent my first large project written in C, focused on Understanding program structure, data modeling with strutcs, and introductory authentication concepts.

Altho the implementation is intentionally basic, the project marks my first exposure to security-related ideas, such as password handling, access control, and activity logging.

## How to Use
When the program starts, a main menu will be displayed with the following options:

a) Register user  
b) View users  
c) Log in  
s) Exit  

The user must select the desired option by typing the corresponding letter and pressing Enter.

The program includes two different menus: one for regular users and another for administrators.  
You are encouraged to explore the program to discover its full functionality.

⚠️ **TO CREATE AN ADMINISTRATOR USER, THE PASSWORD IS: ADMINISTRATOR1**

### 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice structured programming in C
- Model users and permissions using struct
- Implement a basic authentication flow
- Explore early security concepts in an academic context

### ⚙️Features

- User registration and login
- Role-based access control (admin / user)
- Reversible password obfuscation (educational purpose)
- Activity logging with timestamps
- Console-based interaction

### 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:

- How to structure a medium-sized program in C
- How to work with strings and user input
- How to separate logic into reusable functions
- The importance of validating input and handling errors
- Early awareness of security concerns in authentication system

### 📈 Future Improvements

If this project were to be rewritten today, the following improvements would be implemented:

- Secure password hashing
- Strict input validation
- Removal of non-portable libraries
- Improved error handling
- Separation into multiple source files

### 🏫 Academic Context

- Language: C
- Paradigm: Structured programming
- Academic level: Second semester (early-stage project)


## 👥 Team & Contributions
This project was developed as a **team-based academic assignment**.

My primary responsibilities included:
- Core program logic and structure
- User authentication flow
- Password handling logic
- Activity logging implementation

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is not intended for production use.
It is preserved as a learning milestone and as evidence of technical growth over time.

### 🤓 Personal Notes

This project is very important to me, as it was my first major project. I had a lot of fun developing it, and it reinforced my passion for two of my favorite areas: security and programming.
